# Principles of Programming Languages - Lab
>Subject: Principles of Programming Languages Lab (B25CE301)

>Faculty: Prof. Jagruti Wagh and Dr. Geetha Chillarge  

>Academic Year: 2025-2026

The subject Principles of Programming Languages (PPL) plays a foundational role in understanding how modern software systems are designed, implemented, and executed. As students and future professionals in computer science, it is essential to explore not only how to write programs, but also why programming languages are designed in particular ways and how their underlying principles influence problem-solving.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts that govern programming languages, such as syntax and semantics, data types, control structures, abstraction mechanisms, memory management, and language paradigms. By studying these core ideas, learners gain the ability to compare different programming languages objectively, understand their strengths and limitations, and choose the right language or paradigm for a given task.

The content of this subject encourages analytical thinking and enables students to look beyond the surface-level syntax of languages. It develops the ability to reason about program behavior, evaluate language design decisions, and appreciate the evolution of programming languages over time from procedural and object-oriented languages to functional, logic-based, and modern multi-paradigm languages.

# Program Outcomes (POs)
Engineering Graduates will be able to:
1. Engineering Knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.
2. Problem Analysis: Identify, formulates, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.
3. Design / development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research – based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.
5. Modern tool usage: Create, select and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.
6. The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.
7.Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.
8. Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.
9. Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.
10. Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions.
11. Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
12. Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
